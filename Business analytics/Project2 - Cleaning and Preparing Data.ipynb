    "A school district wants to predict the per pupil costs of a school based on some high level summary data about the school. This way they’ll have a good estimation of how well a school is managing its costs relative to what the model would predict. You’ve been asked to to prepare the data for modelling.\n",

    "This is good time to rename variables, since the variable names are pretty long. To do this, bring in a select tool. I’ve changed the names to ATT, PATT, PTR, SAL, and PPC. Let’s attached a browse tool and take a look at what we’ve got. Now the data is looks like it's in good format for analysis and modeling.\n",

    "# Identifying and dealing with outliers\n",
    "We are working on providing more detail to this sections. In the meantime, here's an overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check for outliers, let’s start with some scatterplots to visualize the relationship between each predictor variable and the target variable. Since there are four predictor variables, let’s drag in four scatterplot tools, and connect them to the cleaned dataset. Then we configure each one with a different predictor variable, attached browse tools, and run the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with attendance. The box and whisker plots on either axis use the interquartile range to determine whether a point is an outlier. You can see hear there are two dramatic outliers for attendance, so let’s address those first, then come back to the others.. If you need a quick refresher on what to do with outliers, take a look at the notes below the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these outliers, it looks like the data may not be record properly. Let’s look at the observations by attaching a sort tool and browse tool to the dataset. You can see that almost every observation has a decimal, and these two observations seem to be about 10X the average, so it’s highly likely that the data is an error and we should divide by 10. Normally we would validate with the source, but for now we’ll just make the assumption. I’ll use a formula tool to filter out these records, and create another scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "ATTENDANCE: There still is one more outlier. For this one, it seems like the data is probably right, and it’s just a larger school. My concern with keeping this observation is that it may skew the data, creating or masking a relationship with PPC. If I knew that none of the schools I was predicting for were going to be that size, I’d delete it. Otherwise, I’d keep it in. Let’s plan on building a model with and without this variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "PERCENT ATTENDANCE: Now let’s look at percent attendance. There doesn’t appear to be outliers. Great.\n",
    "\n",
    "PUPIL TEACHER RATIO: For Pupil Teacher Ratio, there are 2 outliers, which are the also outliers for PPC. This makes sense since we’d expect the relationship to behave this way. Based on the fitted line, the outliers are in line with the relationship, so we’d leave them in.\n",
    "\n",
    "TEACHER SALARIES: Two records are outliers, with very low salaries. Just like for PTR, these seem to be in line with the trend, and not dramatically different, so it’s probably best to keep them in.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: In this example, because of the small size of the dataset, we could look at each outlier and make decisions. For larger data sets, you’d likely have to make more systematic decisions, such as removing all outliers, or removing the top 1 or 2 percent of observations for each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier Summary\n",
    "So, we kept 4 of the 5 outliers, and we’ll run the model with and without the fifth one. So now we are ready for modeling. Nice work.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do deal with outliers\n",
    "As a reminder, let’s quickly review how to handle an outlier. There are three main methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Delete: When data is erroneous or when the outlier hurts the model's’ ability to make prediction (perhaps the value is very unlikely to appear again so keeping it in the model will skew all other predictions).\n",
    "Impute: Also for when data is erroneous, we could use the average or median value in its place.\n",
    "Leave it: If the data is good data, it may be best to leave the data in and try with and without to see the difference."
