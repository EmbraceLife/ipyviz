## Anomaly detection
Anomaly detection is the search for items or events which do not conform to an expected pattern. These detected patterns are called anomalies and translate to critical and actionable information in various application domains. It is also referred as outliers.

## Association rule
Association rule learning searches for relationships among variables. For example a supermarket might gather data about how the customer purchasing the various products. With the help of association rule, the supermarket can identify which products are frequently bought together and this information can be used for marketing purposes. This is sometimes known as market basket analysis.

## Clustering   
Clustering discovers the groups and structures in the data in some way or another similar way, without using known structures in the data.

## Classification
Classification generalizes known structure to apply to new data. Take an example; an e-mail program might attempt to classify an e-mail as "legitimate" or as "spam" mail.

## Regression
Regression attempts to find a function which models the data with the least error.

## Summarization   
Summarization provides a more compact representation of the data set, which includes visualization and report generation.
